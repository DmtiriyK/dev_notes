# -------------------------------
# 🔁 BASIC LOGIC & LOOPS PRACTICE
# -------------------------------


# 🔹 Task 1: Sum of Digits
# -------------------------
# Ask the user to enter a number.
# The program calculates and prints the sum of all its digits.
#
# Example:
# Input: 12345 → Output: 15

num = input("Enter a number: ")
total = 0

# 🧠 Loop through each character in the string
for digit in num:
    total += int(digit)  # Convert to int and add to the total

print("Sum of digits:", total)


# 🔹 Task 2: Palindrome Checker
# ------------------------------
# Ask the user to input a number.
# The program checks whether it's a palindrome.
#
# Example:
# 12321 → is a palindrome
# 1234 → is NOT a palindrome

num = input("Enter a number: ")
num2 = num[::-1]  # 🧠 Reversed string

if num == num2:
    print("The number", num, "is a palindrome.")
else:
    print("The number", num, "is NOT a palindrome.")


# 🔹 Task 3: Guess the Number Game
# ---------------------------------
# Generate a random number from 1 to 100.
# Give the user up to 10 attempts to guess the number.
# Provide hints: "higher" or "lower".
# Congratulate the user if guessed correctly.

import random

attempts = 0
secret = random.randint(1, 100)

print("Guess the number between 1 and 100. You have 10 attempts.")
guess = int(input("Your guess: "))

while guess != secret:
    if attempts >= 9:
        print("No more attempts! The number was:", secret)
        break

    attempts += 1

    if guess > secret:
        print("The number is smaller.")
    else:
        print("The number is greater.")

    guess = int(input("Try again: "))
else:
    print("Congratulations! You guessed the number:", secret)
    print("Attempts used:", attempts + 1)
