# 🚀 Becoming a Data Analyst (and Not Working for Jerks Anymore)

Hey. I'm not here to impress recruiters with fancy buzzwords.  
I'm here to **build real skills** and **earn the freedom** to live life on my own terms.

## 🔧 What is this?

This repo is my personal **training ground**:  
Notes, solutions, practice — the stuff I'm learning, struggling with, improving at.

No fluff. No tutorial copy-paste. Just real progress.

## 💡 Why This Exists

- I’ve been around computers since I was 10  
- I’ve fought my way through a rough environment, moved countries, and started from scratch  
- Programming gives me **clarity**, **power**, and **a way out**  
- I want to **solve problems**, **earn well**, and **never work for people who don't respect others**
